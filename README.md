# Freebie Tracker

**Freebie Tracker** is a handy tool designed to help developers keep track of all the freebies they receive — whether swag, giveaways, or promotional items — from companies during hackathons, conferences, or other events.

## Project Overview

This app models the dynamic relationships between:

- **Companies** that distribute freebies,
- **Developers** who collect freebies,
- **Freebies** themselves, which are linked to both a company and a developer.

The goal is to provide a structured and intuitive way to record, organize, and query collections of swag.



## Features

- **Record Transactions:** Log which developer received which item from which company.
- **Company Freebie View:** Display all freebies given out by a specific company.
- **Developer Collection View:** See all freebies collected by a particular developer.
- **Relationship Tracking:** Identify which developers hold freebies from which companies.
- **Freebie Transfers:** Transfer freebies between developers seamlessly.
