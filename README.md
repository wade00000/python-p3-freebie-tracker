# Freebie Tracker

**Freebie Tracker** is your developer-sidekick for cataloging swag, giveaways, and promotional treasures snagged from hackathons, conferences, and events. Never lose track of that elusive T-shirt or sticker pack again.

## Project Overview

This app elegantly models the real-world relationships between:

- **Companies** dishing out freebies,  
- **Developers** eagerly collecting them,  
- **Freebies** themselves—linked to both their origin and their proud owners.

The goal? To provide a clear, intuitive system for logging, organizing, and querying your collection of coveted swag.

## Key Features

- **Transaction Logging:** Effortlessly record which developer scored what item from which company.  
- **Company Freebie Catalog:** Instantly view every freebie distributed by any company.  
- **Developer Inventory:** Quickly browse all swag owned by a developer.  
- **Relationship Mapping:** Reveal who holds freebies from which companies — perfect for competitive bragging rights.  
- **Seamless Transfers:** Easily transfer freebies between developers without breaking a sweat.
